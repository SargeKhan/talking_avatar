So there are multiple different things we can do with a speech to speech visual avatar in the domain of speech improvements.
Initially, I've thought only about the speech impairement that mom had. However, there are multiple different type of impairement. They are chiefly divided in the following different categories:
1- For speech impaired after stroke - these are people who don't have the ability to speak. In terms of audio understanding scope, this is going to be a difficult problem to solve.
2- For those with stuttering - This is for the people who have difficulty speaking one or two words. Including people like Usman's brother - omer. 
3- For those who want to learn a new language. These people include people like omar bhai and the likes.

Roadmap / Plan for the next few weeks; 
- Clean up the code so that it's easier for anyone to work with the tool. This means:
    - [ ] Remove the API key from the codebase
    - [x] Remove the speech therapy session progress sidebar; 
    - [x] Remove communicatating using a dialog box/ chatbox.
    - [x] Add a very visual "Press space to speak" button.
- Ask Haris to build a website. With three main usecases or one website for each usecase.
- Talk with Kashif and assign him a few tasks.
